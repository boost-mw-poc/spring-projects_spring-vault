[[vault.core.client.support]]
= Client support

Spring Vault supports various HTTP clients to access Vault's HTTP API. Spring Vault uses
{spring-framework-docs}integration.html#rest-resttemplate[`RestTemplate`] as primary interface accessing Vault.
Dedicated client support originates from <<vault.client-ssl,customized SSL configuration>>
that is scoped only to Spring Vault's client components.

Spring Vault supports following HTTP imperative clients:

* Java's builtin `HttpClient` (default client if no other is available)
* Apache Http Components
* Reactor Netty
* Jetty

Spring Vault's reactive integration supports the following reactive HTTP clients:

* Java's builtin reactive `HttpClient` (default client if no other is available)
* Apache Http Components
* Reactor Netty
* Jetty

Using a specific client requires the according dependency to be available on the classpath
so Spring Vault can use the available client for communicating with Vault.

== Java's builtin `HttpClient`

Java's builtin `HttpClient` is available out-of-the-box since Java 11 without additional
dependencies.

== External Clients
You can use external clients to access Vault's API. Simply add one of the following
dependencies to your project. You can omit the version number if using
<<dependencies,Spring Vault's Dependency BOM>>


.Apache Http Components Dependency

NOTE: Apache HttpClient's https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.2.x/logging.html[wire logging] can be enabled through logging configuration. Make sure to not accidentally enable wire logging as logs may expose traffic (tokens and secrets) between your application and Vault in plain text.

[[vault.client-ssl]]
== Vault Client SSL configuration

SSL can be configured using javadoc:org.springframework.vault.support.SslConfiguration[] by setting various properties.
You can set either `javax.net.ssl.trustStore` to configure
JVM-wide SSL settings or configure `SslConfiguration`
to set SSL settings only for Spring Vault.

====
[source,java]
----

SslConfiguration sslConfiguration = SslConfiguration.create(            <1>
		new FileSystemResource("client-cert.jks"), "changeit".toCharArray(),
		new FileSystemResource("truststore.jks"), "changeit".toCharArray());

SslConfiguration.forTrustStore(new FileSystemResource("keystore.jks"),  <2>
                                      "changeit".toCharArray())

SslConfiguration.forKeyStore(new FileSystemResource("keystore.jks"),    <3>
                                      "changeit".toCharArray())

SslConfiguration.forKeyStore(new FileSystemResource("keystore.jks"),    <4>
                                      "changeit".toCharArray(),
                                      KeyConfiguration.of("key-password".toCharArray(),
                                      "my-key-alias"))
----
<1> Full configuration.
<2> Configuring only trust store settings.
<3> Configuring only key store settings.
<4> Configuring only key store settings with providing a key-configuration.
====

Please note that providing javadoc:org.springframework.vault.support.SslConfiguration[] can be only applied when Apache Http Components is on your class-path.

The SSL configuration supports also PEM-encoded certificates as alternative to a Java Key Store.

====
[source,java]
----
KeyStoreConfiguration keystore = KeyStoreConfiguration
        .of(new ClassPathResource("ca.pem")).withStoreType("PEM");
SslConfiguration configuration = SslConfiguration.forTrustStore(keystore);
----
====

PEM files may contain one or more certificates (blocks of `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`).
Certificates added to the underlying `KeyStore` use the full subject name as alias.
